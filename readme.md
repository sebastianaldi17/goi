# Goi (語彙)

**Goi** is a personal learning project that collects and organizes Japanese vocabulary by estimated JLPT level. It is designed as a full-stack application to help me practice backend and frontend development, as well as database modeling.

Vocabulary is curated from publicly available sources such as [Jisho.org](https://jisho.org), and tagged with metadata like definition, part of speech, and level estimates.
